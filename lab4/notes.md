# Lab 4 Answers

## Question 1
`--global` means the Git configuration applies to the user on the whole computer, rather than only the current repository. If it is omitted, the setting applies only to the current repository.

## Question 2
`ls -a` showed the `.git` directory, which does not normally appear with `ls`. It contains Git's repository information, including its history and configuration.

## Question 3
Git was offering to track many files and folders, especially the files inside `.venv/`. The `.venv/` files were created by the Python virtual environment, not written as part of my lab work.

## Question 4
After creating `.gitignore`, the files inside `.venv/` no longer appeared in `git status`. Git now ignores the files and folders listed in `.gitignore`.

## Question 5
`.gitignore` should be committed because it is a file containing rules for the repository. It tells Git which files and folders should not be tracked.

## Question 6
README.md moved from the untracked-files section to the changes-to-be-committed section after `git add README.md`. This means the file was staged and is ready to be included in the commit.

## Question 7
After the commit, Git printed a message showing that 2 files changed, with 1 insertion and the deletion of `symbol`. This confirms that the staged changes were saved in the commit.

## Question 8
The first seven characters are the short form of the commit hash. They identify that particular commit so Git can refer to it easily.

## Question 9
The four steps were checking the status, staging the file with `git add`, saving the changes with `git commit`, and checking the history with `git log --oneline`. This is the basic edit-stage-commit-check cycle.

## Question 10
README.md gets a special name and location because GitHub automatically displays it on the repository's front page. This lets visitors immediately see information about the project.

## Question 11
`gh auth login` authenticates the GitHub CLI with my GitHub account. After authentication, GitHub can remember the login credentials so I do not have to enter a password every time I use the CLI.

## Question 12
GitHub shows the contents of README.md on the repository's front page. It does this because GitHub automatically renders a file named README.md as the repository description.

## Question 13
No, pushing did not change my local history. `git push` copied my existing local commits to GitHub.

## Question 14
A private repository exists on GitHub but only people with permission can access it. If there is no repository at all, there is nothing on GitHub to access or collaborate on.
